# Neuropathy-feedback-device
This project attempts to make a wearable haptic feedback device which assists people with neuropathic symptoms in gaining back feedback in the limbs they have less neural feedback from. This project is not an attempt to cure Neuropathy. Merely an attempt to make a haptic feedback wearable device which is user friendly and easy to make. 
## The system components
- 2x Seeed studio xiao nRF52840
- Flexible Force sensing resistors (FSR)
- vibration motor modules
- 10 kOhm resistors 
- 2 lithium ion batteries 1250 mAh (this can change in the future when the code is optimized and power usage is known)
- 2 switches
## Schematic Peripheral
The actual components used vary from the schematic. I just chose symbols that made sense to give you an indication on how the circuit works. In a final version I will of course make all the components and PCB files needed. But that will take a while.
