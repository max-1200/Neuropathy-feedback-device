# Neuropathy-feedback-device
This project attempts to make a wearable haptic feedback device which assists people with neuropathic symptoms in gaining back feedback in the limbs they have less neural feedback from. This project is not an attempt to cure Neuropathy. Merely an attempt to make a haptic feedback wearable device which is user friendly.
